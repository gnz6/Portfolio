              These past months i've completed my studies at Henry, where they prepared me to be a FullStack Developer, teaching tecnologies such as React, Node, Express, Redux, Sequelize among others.
              I'm a pretty disciplined person, and a proactive one, often looking for new challenges to expand my knowledge, and thats what i like the most of programming, constant learning and adaptation.
              I've feel confident in my soft skills, i worked as manager in a store for years and i always had great work environments, also i coordinated a students group as Teaching Assistant at Henry meanwhile i was finishing my studies.
